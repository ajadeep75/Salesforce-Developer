----------------------------------------------------VISUALFORCE CONCEPTS------------------------------------------------------------

-> Visualforce is a framework that allows developers to build sophisticated custom user interfaces that can be hosted natively on the
force.com platform

-> The visualforce framework includes a tag based markup language similar to HTML and a set of server-side standard controllers that make
basic database operations such as queries and saves very simple to perform

-> A visualforce pays definition consists of two primary elements
	1.Visualforce Markup
	2.Visualforce Controller


1.Visualforce Markup:

It consists of visualforce tags, HTML, Javascript or any other web enabled code embedded within a single <apex:page> tag. The markup
defines the UI Components that should be included on the page and the way they should appear.


2.Visualforce Controller:

It is a set of instructions that specify what happens when a user interacts with the components specified in the associated visualforce
markup such as when a user clicks a button or link. Controllers also provide access to data that should be displayed in a page and can 
modify component behavior.
